Notes on using Spark Motors (vs TalonSRX): The Spark_Motor_Files folder has everything you need + instructions

Other Notes:

-Github Desktop is amazing use it

-Mr. G's presentation is a great place to start if you're a beginner (and even if you're not, it's good for learning the conventions). It covers everything from installing Visual Studio to the 2020 command pattern. Find it here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/13qtdxtEjfMWCK2DMAWKFMczQvWsabSRP/view?usp=sharing (as of 1/28/2020)

-2020_Real is the main project for robot code, use that instead of CVHS_Command_Drive
