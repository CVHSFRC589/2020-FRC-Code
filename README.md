Notes on using Spark Motors (vs TalonSRX): The Spark_Motor_Files folder has everything you need + instructions

Other Notes:

-Github Desktop is amazing use it

-Mr. G's presentation is a great place to start if you're a beginner (and even if you're not, it's good for learning the conventions). It covers everything from installing Visual Studio to the 2020 command pattern. Find it here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1E5VYH6ZF74bmZXP7EM5VGHjSb0YEEecA/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114531571764398288590&rtpof=true&sd=true (as of 1/12/2022). NOTE: Please use "slideshow" view and advance through the presentation with arrow keys.

-2020_Real is the main project for robot code, use that instead of CVHS_Command_Drive

-If you plan to work on any code, please create a branch first and work off of that. Thanks!

-Look at releases for baseline regional (working) code
